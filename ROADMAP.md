# Kdrant Roadmap

This document tracks where Kdrant is going. It complements the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md)
(which records what has already shipped) and the short *Roadmap* section in the
[README](README.md). How milestones and shipped-state are marked here follows the shared
[roadmap conventions](ROADMAP-CONVENTIONS.md) — the same standard Kmemo uses.

As of `1.0`, Kdrant's public API is stable under SemVer (see [STABILITY.md](STABILITY.md)); the post-`1.0`
milestones below are additive and may be re-ordered as the project learns. Every public-API change is
tracked by the binary-compatibility-validator (`*.api` files), so breakage is never silent.

## Guiding principles

- **Coroutine-first and idiomatic.** Every operation is a `suspend` function or a `Flow`;
  cancellation is cooperative and `CancellationException` is always propagated. New surface area
  follows the same type-safe, scope-isolated DSL style rather than exposing raw request objects.
- **Small footprint, REST by default.** The default engine stays a pure-Kotlin Ktor + `kotlinx-serialization`
  stack — no gRPC, Netty, or protobuf on the classpath unless you opt in.
- **Pluggable transport seam.** All wire-protocol work sits behind `QdrantTransport`. A gRPC engine
  is an *opt-in* module, never a requirement, and the REST engine remains the recommended default.
- **Positioning rule.** Compete on developer experience, footprint, cold-start / GraalVM
  friendliness, and Kotlin idioms — not on raw gRPC throughput. Benchmarks stay honest about the
  cases where the official gRPC client is the better choice.

## Status — `1.1.0` (current)

`1.1.0` is a maintenance & compatibility release on top of `1.0.0`. The Spring adapters move to the current
framework generation — **`kdrant-spring-ai` targets Spring AI `2.0`** and **`kdrant-spring-boot-starter`
targets Spring Boot `4.1`** (applications on Spring AI 1.x / Spring Boot 3.x should pin those modules to
`1.0.0`); **`kdrant-langchain4j`** builds against LangChain4j `1.18`. The toolchain moves to Kotlin `2.4.10`
and Gradle `9.6.1`, and the Kotlin modules now compile with `allWarningsAsErrors` so deprecations can't slip
in. Kdrant's own public API is unchanged.

## Status — `1.0.0`

`1.0.0` marks a **stable public API** under SemVer (see [STABILITY.md](STABILITY.md)). On top of `0.2.0`
it adds aliases and snapshots (M19–M20); observability & a granular transport seam with a no-boxing hot
path and streaming ingest (M21); quality & CI hardening — ktlint/detekt, a JDK & Qdrant-version matrix,
Dependabot, property-based tests (M22); the **Spring Boot / Spring AI / LangChain4j** integrations and a
runnable RAG example (M23); and the `catching` helper, this stability policy, and a JMH benchmark harness
(M24). Koog is scoped as an upstream contribution.

## Status — `0.2.0`

`0.2.0` is a large feature release on top of `0.1.0`'s core (collections, `upsert`, `delete`, `count`,
`retrieve`, `scroll` as a `Flow`, and the full filter DSL). It adds:

- **Correctness & security (M10):** the delete-by-filter data-loss fix, TLS enforced when an API key is
  set, `404` message/`exists` handling, and client-side parameter validation.
- **Resilience (M11):** retries with exponential backoff + jitter honoring `Retry-After`, and a finer
  `KdrantException` taxonomy (`RateLimited` / `ServiceUnavailable` / `ServerError` / `AlreadyExists`).
- **Typed DX (M12):** `kdrantJson`, `payloadAs<T>` / `searchAs<T>` / `Hit<T>`, `getCollectionOrNull`,
  `createCollectionIfNotExists`, a `createCollection(name, size, distance)` shorthand, and `PayloadBuilder` sugar.
- **Positioning (M13):** the `kdrant-bom` module, richer POM metadata, a footprint comparison table, and a
  Dokka multi-module docs site on GitHub Pages.
- **Modern search engine (M14–M16):** the polymorphic `/points/query` (`QueryInterface`), nestable
  `prefetch`, RRF/DBSF fusion, sparse & multi-vectors, `recommend` / `discover` / `context`, `searchBatch`,
  and `searchGroups`.
- **Data & collection management (M17–M18):** payload field indexes, payload & vector mutations, and
  `updateCollection` (PATCH) with optimizers / HNSW / quantization.

Published to Maven Central and GitHub Packages.

## Effort legend

`S` ≈ hours–1 day · `M` ≈ several days · `L` ≈ 1–2 weeks · `XL` ≈ multi-week / multiple sub-parts.

---

## Tier 0 — Correctness & security patch — ✅ Shipped in `0.2.0`

### M10 · Correctness & security hardening — `S`

Ship the fixes that protect data and credentials before pushing adoption.

- Harden **delete-by-filter** so a filter that ends up with no effective conditions can never be
  sent as a match-all: normalise empty clause lists to `null` in `FilterBuilder.build()` (and/or
  check real non-emptiness at the call site), with regression tests for empty `must {}` /
  `should {}` / `minShould(0) {}` blocks.
- **Enforce TLS when an API key is set** — `require(apiKey == null || useTls)` in `KdrantConfig`
  (the KDoc already states TLS is required when sending a key); optionally default `useTls = true`
  when a key is present.
- Preserve the server's error message on `404` and treat `404` on `/exists` as `false` to match the
  `collectionExists` contract.
- Client-side validation of numeric parameters (vector `size > 0`, `shardNumber`,
  `replicationFactor`) with messages that echo the received value.
- Remove `local.properties` from version control (`git rm --cached` + `.gitignore`).

---

## Tier 1 — Robustness, DX & reach — ✅ Shipped in `0.2.0`

### M11 · Resilience & error taxonomy — `M`

Make the client resilient to transient failures and return actionable, correctly-classified errors.

- Install Ktor `HttpRequestRetry` with exponential backoff + jitter, limited to `429/502/503/504`
  and `IOException`, honouring the `Retry-After` header.
- New `KdrantException` subtypes: `RateLimited(retryAfter)`, `ServiceUnavailable`, `ServerError`,
  `AlreadyExists`; map `429 → RateLimited` and `503 → ServiceUnavailable` **before** the generic
  `4xx → InvalidRequest` catch-all.
- Expose `maxRetries` and backoff parameters in `KdrantConfig`; document which exceptions are retryable.

### M12 · DX front door — typed payloads & collection convenience — `S`

Make Kdrant the API "you'd write by hand", removing boilerplate from the first-run experience.

- A public default `Json` + `payloadAs<T>()` on `ScoredPoint` / `Record`, plus
  `searchAs<T>(): List<Hit<T>>` — the primary RAG pattern, and the headline of the README.
- `getCollectionOrNull` and `createCollectionIfNotExists(...): Boolean` as pure extensions
  (race-tolerant once `KdrantException.AlreadyExists` from M11 lands; otherwise documented as best-effort).
- A `createCollection(name, size, distance = COSINE)` overload for the common case.
- `PayloadBuilder`: `put(List)`, `put(Map)`, `operator fun set(key, value: Any?)`.
- Keep `upsertBatchSize` a REST-engine concern (a named parameter of the `Kdrant(...)` factory), **not**
  in the transport-neutral core config — decided against moving it into `KdrantConfigBuilder` to preserve
  the core's protocol independence.

### M13 · Positioning & discoverability — `M`

Turn the "coroutine-first, no-gRPC" wedge into a quantified, repeatable message and get found where
Kotlin/JVM developers discover libraries.

- A quantified comparison table vs `io.qdrant:client` (transitive deps, classpath MB, cold-start,
  GraalVM, Kotlin idioms) and a single tagline replicated across POM / GitHub about / site.
- Rich POM metadata: `description`, keywords, `url`, `scm`.
- A Dokka multi-module docs site on GitHub Pages (quickstart, filters, RAG, migration guides).
- Community listings: PR to the Qdrant community/clients page, `awesome-kotlin`, Qdrant DevRel contact.
- A `kdrant-bom` (`java-platform`) module published alongside the other artifacts.

---

## Tier 2 — Search engine at parity with Qdrant — ✅ Shipped in `0.2.0`

Kdrant already calls the modern `/points/query` endpoint, but only models its "nearest-dense" shape.
These three milestones open up the full polymorphic query interface — the biggest functional gap.

### M14 · Query API foundations: `/points/query`, prefetch, fusion — `M`

Introduce Qdrant's modern query architecture as the common root; without it, hybrid, recommend, and
discovery are not expressible.

- A `sealed QueryInterface` (`Nearest`, `Fusion`, `ById`, `OrderBy`, `Sample`, …) as the root of the
  `/points/query` body.
- A nestable `prefetch { query(...); using = ...; limit = ... }` block + `prefetch` on `SearchRequest`.
- `Fusion.RRF(k, weights)` / `Fusion.DBSF` combined with multiple prefetch clauses (hybrid search).
- A `query(id: PointId)` overload (reuse a stored vector) and a `lookup_from(collection, vector)` field.
- `OrderBy(key, direction, startFrom)` and `Sample(RANDOM)`; add `order_by` to `scroll` too.

### M15 · Sparse & multivectors, end-to-end — `L`

Support sparse and multi-vector / late-interaction (ColBERT) embeddings in storage, config, and
query — and make the transport tolerant of non-dense shapes.

- `VectorData.Sparse(indices, values)`; `sparse_vectors` config in `createCollection`; a sparse
  query variant in `QueryInterface`.
- Multivector config at creation; `VectorData.MultiDense(List<List<Float>>)`; a multivector (ColBERT) query.
- Extend the REST (de)serializers for sparse / multi / mixed-named vectors, degrading unknown shapes
  gracefully instead of failing the whole response (today only dense / named-dense parse).
- (De)serialization tests for the non-dense shapes.

### M16 · Advanced retrieval: recommend, discovery, grouping, batch, rerank — `L`

Complete Qdrant's advanced retrieval coverage on top of the `QueryInterface` base.

- `RecommendInput(positive, negative, strategy)` + a `recommend { … }` DSL.
- `DiscoverInput(target, context)` and `ContextInput(pairs)` + a dedicated DSL.
- `searchGroups(name) { groupBy = …; groupSize = … }` on `/points/query/groups`.
- `searchBatch(name, List<SearchRequest>): List<List<ScoredPoint>>` on `/points/query/batch`.
- Reranking: a `Formula(expression)` variant with a minimal AST, plus an `mmr` option on nearest queries.

---

## Tier 3 — Complete data & collection management

### M17 · Payload / vector mutations & payload indexes — `M`

**Status: ✅ Shipped in `0.2.0`.**

Make the already-shipped filter DSL genuinely useful (filters don't scale without indexes) and
complete data mutation.

- Payload indexes: `createPayloadIndex(name, field, schema) { … }` + `deletePayloadIndex`; a sealed
  `PayloadFieldSchema` (Keyword / Integer / Float / Bool / Geo / Datetime / Uuid / Text).
- Payload mutations: `setPayload` / `overwritePayload` / `deletePayload` / `clearPayload`, reusing
  `DeleteSelector` (`Ids | ByFilter`) and `PayloadBuilder`, with nested-key support.
- `updateVectors` (`PUT /points/vectors`) and `deleteVectors` (`POST /points/vectors/delete`).
- `batchUpdate(name) { … }` with a sealed `UpdateOperation` (`POST /points/batch`). Note: this is a
  **single ordered request** applying a mixed sequence of point/vector/payload operations — ordered,
  but **not transactional** (no all-or-nothing rollback across operations).

### M18 · Full collection config & richer read-back — `L`

**Status: ✅ Shipped in `0.2.0`.**

Bring `createCollection` / `updateCollection` up to production config and expose in read-back what
the convenience helpers need.

- `updateCollection(name) { optimizers { }; hnsw { }; quantization { }; vectors { … }; params { … }; strictMode { } }`.
- A sealed `QuantizationConfig` (Scalar / Product / Binary), collection- and per-vector level, with
  rescore / oversampling in the search params.
- Extend `createCollection` with `optimizers { }`, `wal { }`, `strictMode { }`; share models between
  create and update. Note: `optimizers` and `strict_mode` config apply to both create and update, but
  `wal` config is **create-only**. (`init_from` is intentionally omitted — it was removed from the
  current Qdrant API.)
- Enrich `CollectionInfo` (today: status / points / indexed / segments) with
  `config.params.vectors` (size / distance), `payload_schema`, and `optimizer_status` — which finally
  unblocks a correctness-checking `ensureCollection`.

### M19 · Aliases, service & analytics endpoints — `M`

**Status: ✅ Shipped in `1.0.0`.** All three groups below shipped, with MockEngine wire tests.

Round out the operational surface: zero-downtime reindex, server-side health, and analytics.

- Aliases: `updateAliases { createAlias / deleteAlias / renameAlias }` + `listAliases()` /
  `listCollectionAliases(name)` (`POST /collections/aliases`) — enables zero-downtime reindex.
- Service endpoints: `healthz()` / `readyz()` / `livez()`, `listCollections()`, and optional
  `telemetry()` / `metrics()` (Prometheus, non-JSON) and `listIssues()`.
- Analytics: `searchMatrix(sample, limit)` (pairs / offsets forms) and `facet(key, filter, limit, exact)`.

### M20 · Snapshots & backup / restore — `L`

**Status: ✅ Shipped in `1.0.0`** for the collection and full-storage scopes. **Shard-scope
snapshots are deferred.**

Provide the backup/restore story enterprise adoption expects, designed separately because of binary bodies.

- `createSnapshot` / `listSnapshots` / `deleteSnapshot` / `recoverSnapshot(location)` for
  collection and full-storage scopes (shard scope deferred).
- Streaming download (`downloadSnapshot` → `Flow<ByteArray>`) / upload (`uploadSnapshot` from a
  `Flow<ByteArray>`, multipart) with binary Ktor bodies, as a dedicated API distinct from the JSON surface.

---

## Tier 4 — Production reliability, ecosystem & the road to `1.0` — ✅ Shipped in `1.0.0`

### M21 · Observability, granular transport & no-boxing hot path — `L`

**Status: ✅ Shipped in `1.0.0`.** Delivered: the `configureClient` client-customization seam,
`connectTimeout` / `socketTimeout`, api-key-redacting logging, `Flow` / `Sequence` upsert, the
`FloatArray` no-boxing dense path (`vector` / `query`), and byte-aware upsert batching (`maxUpsertBytes`).
**Deferred:** the `X-Request-Id` correlation header and bundled Micrometer / OpenTelemetry hooks — both
reachable today through the `configureClient` seam.

Open the transport up to extension and observability, and optimise the hot upsert/search paths and
streaming ingestion.

- A public `HttpClientConfig<*>.() -> Unit` seam (or plugin install hook) in `KdrantConfig` / factory.
- An optional Logging plugin with api-key redaction + correlation headers (`X-Request-Id`), plus
  metrics / tracing hooks (Micrometer / OpenTelemetry).
- Separate `connectTimeout` / `socketTimeout` and CIO tuning
  (`maxConnectionsPerRoute`, `keepAliveTime`, …).
- A `FloatArray`-backed dense representation with a dedicated serializer (zero boxing on the hot path)
  + `FloatArray` overloads on `vector` / `query`.
- Upsert from `Flow<PointStruct>` / `Sequence` (reusing the chunking) and **byte-aware adaptive
  batching** so the documented 32 MiB REST cap is actually respected (today batching is by point count).

### M22 · Quality, supply chain & test depth (CI) — `M`

**Status: ✅ Shipped in `1.0.0`** (some sub-items deferred). Delivered: **ktlint** + **detekt** as `check` gates
(configured to the codebase's style); a JDK `17` / `21` build matrix and a Qdrant-version matrix
(pinned + `latest`) via Testcontainers; **Gradle wrapper-validation**; a **dependency-review** step on
PRs; **Dependabot** (Gradle + GitHub Actions, grouped); and **property-based round-trip** tests on the
`@Serializable` models (kotest-property). **Deferred:** **Kover** coverage (0.9.1 is not yet compatible
with the Kotlin 2.4 Gradle plugin); build-provenance / SLSA attestation + a `main` snapshot job; and
contract tests vs the Qdrant OpenAPI schema.

Bring CI and tests up to a mature OSS standard and catch wire-format regressions across Qdrant versions.

- Kover (report + minimum threshold, badge) + detekt + ktlint as Gradle tasks and CI gates.
- Dependabot / Renovate (Gradle + GitHub Actions) + a dependency-review / CVE step on PRs.
- A JDK `17 / 21 (/ 23)` matrix and a Qdrant-version matrix (latest minor + previous) via Testcontainers.
- `gradle/actions/wrapper-validation`; build-provenance / SLSA attestation on release; a snapshot job on `main`.
- Property-based round-trip encode/decode tests on the `@Serializable` models + contract tests vs the
  Qdrant OpenAPI schema.

### M23 · Ecosystem: Spring Boot / Spring AI / LangChain4j / Koog & a RAG app — `XL`

**Status: ✅ Shipped in `1.0.0`** (Koog = upstream contribution). Delivered: the **`kdrant-spring-boot-starter`** (`@ConfigurationProperties("kdrant")`
+ `@AutoConfiguration` exposing a `destroyMethod = "close"`, `@ConditionalOnMissingBean` `QdrantClient`
bean; `ApplicationContextRunner` test) and **`kdrant-spring-ai`** (a Spring AI `VectorStore` backed by
Kdrant — `add` / `delete` / `similaritySearch`, embedding via a Spring AI `EmbeddingModel`; metadata-filter
expressions are not yet translated) and **`kdrant-langchain4j`** (a LangChain4j `EmbeddingStore<TextSegment>`
— `add` / `addAll` / `search`; metadata filters not yet translated), and the runnable **`example-rag`** app
(Ktor + Kdrant, ingest → embed → retrieve, `docker-compose` for Qdrant).

**Koog** stays an **upstream contribution** (as originally scoped). Its RAG storage SPI —
`ai.koog.rag.vector.backend.VectorStorageBackend<Document>` (coroutine-first: `store` / `delete` / `read` /
`readWithPayload` / `allDocuments` + ranking) — is a natural fit for a Kdrant-backed impl, but it lives in
Koog's own `rag-vector` module, which is not published to Maven Central at a resolvable coordinate. The
integration therefore belongs in the Koog repository (or awaits a published Koog `rag-vector` artifact),
rather than as a `kdrant-koog` module here.

Meet JVM developers inside the ecosystems they already use, and publish the single highest-leverage
adoption driver: a runnable RAG demo. (Depends on query/collection completeness — M14–M18.)

- `kdrant-spring-boot-starter`: `@ConfigurationProperties("kdrant")` + auto-config exposing a
  `QdrantClient` bean (`destroyMethod = "close"`, `@ConditionalOnMissingBean`).
- `kdrant-koog`: a `VectorStorage` / `EmbeddingBasedDocumentStorage` backend for JetBrains Koog
  (contributed upstream).
- `kdrant-spring-ai` (`VectorStore`) and `kdrant-langchain4j` (`EmbeddingStore`): a one-line-dependency
  migration that swaps the gRPC stack for the REST transport.
- `examples/`: a runnable RAG app (Ktor + an embedding provider + Kdrant, docker-compose for Qdrant),
  linked at the top of the README.
- A coordinated launch with Qdrant DevRel (blog + Kotlin Weekly / r/Kotlin / Slack).

### M24 · The road to `1.0`: stability, benchmarks, final ergonomics — `M`

**Status: ✅ Shipped in `1.0.0` — this completes Tier 4.** Delivered: a written semver/stability
policy + `1.0` scope-and-date plan ([STABILITY.md](STABILITY.md)); a JMH latency harness for upsert/search
([`benchmarks/`](benchmarks/)); the `catching { }` helper (coroutine-safe `Result<T>`); and the documented
Java-interop decision (Kotlin-first; bridge via `kotlinx-coroutines-jdk8`; no bundled facade in `1.0`).
The reproducible benchmark *numbers* and the `1.0` tag itself land when the `0.x` line is released and baked.

Cut `1.0` with written stability guarantees and back the footprint claims with reproducible numbers.

- A written semver / stability policy + a `1.0` scope-and-date plan; cut `1.0` once the REST core is
  stable (snapshots + aliases done) — without waiting for gRPC.
- A JMH benchmark repo (p50/p99 upsert/search latency) + a footprint table vs `io.qdrant:client`,
  repeatable in CI; honest about where gRPC wins.
- A `catching { }` helper returning `Result<T>` (re-throwing `CancellationException`); the
  exception-based style stays primary.
- Decide and document the Java-interop position; an optional `kdrant-jdk` facade
  (`CompletableFuture`) if warranted.

---

## Tier 5 — Post-`1.0`

### M25 · KMP, optional gRPC, cluster / sharding — `L`

Expand the market after `1.0` without delaying its time-to-market.

- Convert `kdrant-core` to Kotlin Multiplatform `commonMain`: drop the hard-coded `Dispatchers.IO`,
  parameterise the Ktor engine, and replace the two `java.*` APIs with Ktor equivalents; publish KMP
  targets of the REST engine. (The core is already ~80% there.) Announce on klibs.io / kmp-awesome.
- `kdrant-transport-grpc` as a separate, opt-in module (REST stays the recommended default);
  document the footprint-vs-throughput/streaming trade-off.
- Cluster / sharding: `collectionClusterInfo(name)` + `updateCollectionCluster(name) { … }` and
  `createShardKey` / `deleteShardKey`.
